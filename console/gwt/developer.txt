1.  Eclipse configuration
	1.  Import using Import... "Existing Maven Projects"
	2.  After importing, open project properties.
		1.  On the Google->Web Application page:
			1.  Ensure "This project has a WAR directory" is checked.
			2.  Change the WAR directory to point to
				${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName} (e.g.
				"target/switchyard-console-gwt-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT").
			3.  Make sure "Launch and deploy from this directory..." is checked.
		2.  On the Google->Web Toolkit page:
			1.  Ensure "Use Google Web Toolkit" is checked.
			2.  Ensure "Use specific SDK" is selected and is pointing to the
				maven dependencies (e.g. ~/.m2/repository/com/google/gwt/...).
	3.  To run you can do one of the following:
		1.  Right-click project and select Run as->Web Application.  This will
			launch the application from within Eclipse.
		2.  Right-click module file (e.g. Application.gwt.xml) and select
			Run as->GWT application.  This will launch an external GWT console.

2.  Running in Eclipse (using Run as -> Web Application)
	1.  In the run configuration, you will need to add the following jars to the
		bootstrap entries on the classpath tab:
			jboss-logging-<version>.jar
			xnio-api-<version>.jar
			xnio-nio-<version>.jar
		These jars should come from your AS installation.  If you are
		experiencing other ClassNotFoundExceptions, you will need to add those
		jars to the bootstrap entries as well.  This is to workaround
		classLoader issues in gwt-dev.
