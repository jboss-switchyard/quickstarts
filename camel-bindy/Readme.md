Introduction
============
This quickstart demonstrates the usage of the Camel Bindy component within a
SwitchYard service.  The service unmarshals a delimited String into Order
objects, and then makes two changes to the Orders - it sets the
price of any "Lucky Charms" order to 17, and it changes any "Grape Nuts" 
orders to "Cheerios".

This example is invoked through a File gateway binding.
