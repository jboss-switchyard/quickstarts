Introduction
============
This quickstart demonstrates the usage of a camel binding. This example shows a GreetingService 
which prints a hello message. The camel binding redirects a textfile as input for the 
GreetingServices' hello message.

Preqrequisites

Maven

Running the quickstart
======================

1. Build the quickstart:

        mvn clean install

2. Run the test:

        mvn -Dtest=CamelBindingTest test


Expected Output:
================
There's a lot of camel logging to dig through, but the output you are looking for looks like the 
following - you should see the "Hello there Captain Crunch :-)" message :

```
