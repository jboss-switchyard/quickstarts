Introduction
============
This quickstart demonstrates the usage of a rules service in conjunction with a camel service, creating a Content-Based Router.
This quickstart also demonstrates the ability to use MVEL expressions to extract objects (the Widgets from their Boxes) and insert them as facts inside the rules engine.
The drl resource is specified using annotations within the DestinationServiceRules interface, and checks the id of Widgets to determine the destination to set on their Boxes.
Then, a Camel route looks at the destination set on the Box for each Widget, and routes it to the appropriate service (RedService, GreenService, or BlueService).

If you would like to watch the rules execution, uncomment these lines in
src/main/resources/META-INF/switchyard.xml:
<rules:listeners>
    <rules:listener class="org.kie.api.event.rule.DebugAgendaEventListener"/>
    <rules:listener class="org.kie.api.event.rule.DebugRuleRuntimeEventListener"/>
</rules:listeners>

Preqrequisites 
==============
Maven

Running the quickstart
======================


EAP
----------
1. Start EAP in standalone mode:

        ${AS}/bin/standalone.sh

2. Build and deploy the Quickstart :

        mvn install -Pdeploy

3. Use the RulesCamelCBRClient class to send a request message to the Dealer service.  The client can be
   run from the command-line using:

        mvn exec:java

See the "Expected Output" section for the expected results.

4. Undeploy the quickstart:

        mvn clean -Pdeploy


Wildfly
----------
1. Start Wildfly in standalone mode:

        ${AS}/bin/standalone.sh

2. Build and deploy the Quickstart :

        mvn install -Pdeploy -Pwildfly

3. Use the RulesCamelCBRClient class to send a request message to the Dealer service.  The client can be
run from the command-line using:

        mvn exec:java -Pwildfly

See the "Expected Output" section for the expected results.

4. Undeploy the quickstart:

mvn clean -Pdeploy -Pwildfly


Karaf
----------

1. Start the Karaf server :

${KARAF_HOME}/bin/karaf

2. Add the features URL for the respective version of SwitchYard.   Replace {SWITCHYARD-VERSION}
with the version of SwitchYard that you are using (ex. 2.0.0):

karaf@root> features:addurl mvn:org.switchyard.karaf/switchyard/{SWITCHYARD-VERSION}/xml/features

3. Install the feature for the camel-netty-binding quickstart :

karaf@root> features:install switchyard-quickstart-rules-camel-cbr

4. Execute client and send text message :
<br/>
```
mvn exec:java -Pkaraf
```
<br/>

5. Check the log for the expected results :

karaf@root> log:display 


Expected Output
======================
```
13:52:09,079 INFO  [org.switchyard.quickstarts.rules.camel.cbr.RedServiceBean] (http-/127.0.0.1:8080-1) Red service processing boxed widget with id: FF0000-ABC-123
