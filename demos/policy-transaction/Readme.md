Introduction
============
This quickstart demonstrates how policy can be used to control the transactional characteristics
of a service invocation.  The only service in the application is a Bean service called
"WorkService".  The service accepts commands and can be instructed to rollback by sending a
message containing the string "rollback".

Running the quickstart
======================

1. Build the quickstart:
    mvn clean install
2. Start JBoss AS 7 in standalone-full mode:
    ./standalone --server-config=standalone-full.xml
3. Add JMS user using add-user.sh with username=guest, password=guestp, Realm=ApplicationRealm
    ./add-user.sh
4. Add a guest role to the user "guest"
   echo "guest=guest" >> ${AS7}/standalone/configuration/application-roles.properties
5. Deploy JMS Queue
    cp src/test/resources/switchyard-quickstart-demo-policy-transaction-hornetq-jms.xml ${AS7}/standalone/deployments
6. Deploy the quickstart
    cp target/switchyard-quickstarts-policy-transaction.jar ${AS7}/standalone/deployments
7. Execute HornetQClient
    mvn exec:java
8. Check the server console for output from the service.  With the default
   configuration of the quickstart, you should see the output below in the
   AS server.log.
9. Undeploy the application
    rm ${AS7}/standalone/deployments/switchyard-quickstart-demo-policy-transaction-{version}.jar.deployed
    rm ${AS7}/standalone/deployments/switchyard-quickstart-demo-policy-transaction-hornetq-jms.xml

```
:: WorkService :: Received command =>  rollback
:: WorkService :: Marked transaction to rollback!
:: WorkService :: Received command =>  rollback
:: WorkService :: Marked transaction to rollback!
:: WorkService :: Received command =>  rollback
:: WorkService :: Marked transaction to rollback!
:: WorkService :: Received command =>  rollback
:: WorkService :: Rollbacks completed
```

Scenarios
=========
You can test any of these transaction policy scenarios using this quickstart:

1) Global transaction propagated to the bean service.  This is the default
   configuration of the quickstart and requires the WorkServiceBean to be
   annotated with @Requires(transaction=TransactionPolicy.PROPAGATES_TRANSACTION)
   and messages to be sent to the policyQSTransacted queue.

2) Policy violation - transaction required to be propagated, but no transaction
   provided by the gateway.  To exercise this scenario, send a message to the
   policyQSNonTransacted queue with TransactionPolicy.PROPAGATES_TRANSACTION
   on the bean service.

3) Suspend incoming transaction.  Change the WorkServiceBean transaction
   annotation type to TransactionPolicy.SUSPENDS_TRANSACTION and send a
   message to the policyQSTransacted queue with the command "rollback".  Check
   the output and note that the rollback does not impact the transaction used
   to receive the JMS message.


Options
=======
The maven exec goal in this quickstart accepts the following options:

   mvn exec:java -D exec.args="[command] [queueName]"

Running "mvn exec:java" with no options is equivalent to:

   mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="rollback policyQSTransacted"

If the value for 'command' contains the string "rollback", then the bean service
will attempt to rollback an existing transaction.

The value for 'queueName' should be "policyQSTransacted" or
"policyQSNonTransacted".

Notes
=======

o Due to an issue with shutdown processing, server shutdown may take
  more than 2 minutes when this quickstart is deployed.  To avoid this
  problem, undeploy the application before shutting down the server.
