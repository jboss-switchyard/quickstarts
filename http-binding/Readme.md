Introduction
============
This quickstart demonstrates the usage of HTTP gateway component. It binds two SwitchYard services
over HTTP URLs that can be accessed by any HTTP based client. One of them also acts as a client.
When a message arrives to the Quote service Symbol service will be invoked via reference binding.
